# Lesalon

## Description

This app was built in 2 weeks in July 2015 by me, David Mulberger and Esther Banales. It served as our final project at the end of the immersive fullstack web development course offered by [Le Wagon](www.lewagon.com).

I am in the process of updating it so it can be understood by English speakers.

It's a high-end furniture market place where professional sellers can create an account and upload their products.

Users can views all products available, see seller profiles and order. Note that this is a demo app. None of the products are actually for sale.
