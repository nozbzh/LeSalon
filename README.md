# Lesalon

## Description

This app was built in 2 weeks in July 2015 by me, David Mulberger and Esther Banales. It is deployed on Heroku [here](http://lesalon.herokuapp.com/product_groups?category=Fauteuils). Note that only the category where the link takes you has products.

It's a high-end furniture market place where professional sellers can create an account to sell their products.

Users can views all products available, see seller profiles and order. Note that this is a demo app. None of the products are actually for sale.

Sellers can create products, add special discounts to a specific product (only the orange version of a rocking chair for example) and manage their orders.

Before being allowed on the platform, sellers need to be approved by the admin.
